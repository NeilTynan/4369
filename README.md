# Programming for Data Analytics - Assignments

This README has been written with [GitHub's documentation on README's] (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.

## About this Project

This repository contains my weekly assignments for ATU module 4369 -- PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYTICS. The repository for the big project for 4369 can be found here: https://github.com/NeilTynan/4369_project

## Use of this Project

This repository may be of some interest to other students engaged in similar projects around programming for data analytics. Feel free to use whatever you like from it (though if another party has been referenced, I would ask that you likewise cite them).

## Getting Started

The workbook is structured in a linear fashion, so reading through it from start to finish is the best approach.

To understand how the workbook has developped to date, please see below a timeline of the work done on the notebook and the material referenced in the course of this work:

- 13/10/2024 - Created ReadMe and Gitignore file as per course materials for 24-25: 8645 -- COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE: w02v03_create_your_repository. Gitignore file generated using the template at Python gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore, the Windows gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Windows.gitignore, the MacOS gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/macOS.gitignore and the Linux gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Linux.gitignore.
- 13/10/2024 - Added three folders, as per assigntment 1: assignments, mywork and project.
- 13/10/2024 - Added assignment2-weather to Assignments folder and created graph based on weatherreadings1.csv, as per assignment. Websites referenced in graph creation include https://datagy.io/matplotlib-title/ and https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/ticks/ticks_too_many.html.
- 18/10/2024 - Added assignment03-pie to Assignement folder and creater graph based on people-1000.csv, as per assignement. Websites referenced in graph creation include: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/pie_features.html#.
- 21/10/2024 - Redid elements of assignment03-pie. New material referenced includes: https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/code/topic04-regex/lecture/using%20regex%20in%20pandas.ipynb and https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html. 
- 30/10/2024 - Started assignment 5. New materials referenced include: https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2022/12/30/using-python-numpy-to-improve-board-game-strategy-risk/ (how to generate Risk dice rolls).
- 04/11/2024 - Redid large sections of assignment_5_risk so that the outcomes were more in line with the assigntment. New materials referenced include: https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-numpy-count/ (how to convert dice roll results into a format suitable for plotting).
- 13/11/2024 - Added assigment_6_Weather.ipynb. New materials referenced include the course materials for week 6 (PFDA6.1 datetime in python and PFDA6.2 manipulating timeseries) and https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects (attribute references).
- 21/11/2024 - Updated assignment 6 graphs to have different colours to make the data easier to seperate and digest. Please see [here] (https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*zm6zVTIEvf9uZ0cE4n0Ogg.png) for the colour chart referenced.
