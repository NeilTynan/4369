# Programming for Data Analytics - Assignments

This README has been written with [GitHub's documentation on README's] (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.

## About this Project

This repository contains my weekly assignments for ATU module 4369 -- PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYTICS. It contains the work associated with four assignments, each of which is contained in their own folder. These tasks associated with these assignements include:
- Examining Met Eireann weather data and building a chart based on the data (assigment 2)
- Building a pie chart out of sample data (assignment 3)
- Simulating a game of Risk (assignment 5)
- Building a pie chart out of a email domain database (assignment 6)

## Use of this Project

This repository may be of some interest to other students engaged in similar projects around programming for data analytics. Feel free to use whatever you like from it (though if another party has been referenced, I would ask that you likewise cite them).

## Getting Started

The workbook is structured in a linear fashion, so reading through it from start to finish is the best approach.

To understand how the workbook has developped to date, please see below a timeline of the work done on the notebook and the material referenced in the course of this work:

- 13/10/2024 - Created ReadMe and Gitignore file as per course materials for 24-25: 8645 -- COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE: w02v03_create_your_repository. Gitignore file generated using the template at Python gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore, the Windows gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Windows.gitignore, the MacOS gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/macOS.gitignore and the Linux gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Linux.gitignore.
- 13/10/2024 - Added three folders, as per assigntment 1: assignments, mywork and project.
- 13/10/2024 - Added assignment2-weather to Assignments folder and created graph based on weatherreadings1.csv, as per assignment. Course material referenced included "PFDA2.1 Intro to Data Visualisation (2).pptx", "PFDA2.2 Matplotlib" and "PFDA2.3 Brief intro to axes". External material referenced include: https://datagy.io/matplotlib-title/ and https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/ticks/ticks_too_many.html.
- 18/10/2024 - Added assignment03-pie to Assignement folder and creater graph based on people-1000.csv, as per assignement. Course material referenced included "PFDA3.1 pandas 1" and "PFDA3.2 pandas 2 data manipulation". WExternal material referenced include: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/pie_features.html#.
- 21/10/2024 - Redid elements of assignment03-pie. New material referenced includes: https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/code/topic04-regex/lecture/using%20regex%20in%20pandas.ipynb and https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html. 
- 30/10/2024 - Started assignment 5. Course material referenced included "PFDA5". New external materials referenced include: https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2022/12/30/using-python-numpy-to-improve-board-game-strategy-risk/ (how to generate Risk dice rolls).
- 04/11/2024 - Redid large sections of assignment_5_risk so that the outcomes were more in line with the assigntment. New external materials referenced include: https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-numpy-count/ (how to convert dice roll results into a format suitable for plotting).
- 13/11/2024 - Added assigment_6_Weather.ipynb. Course materials referenced include: "PFDA6.1 datetime in python" and "PFDA6.2 manipulating timeseries". External material referenced include: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects (attribute references).
- 21/11/2024 - Updated assignment 6 graphs to have different colours to make the data easier to seperate and digest. Please see [here](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*zm6zVTIEvf9uZ0cE4n0Ogg.png) for the colour chart referenced. Removed Project and MyWork folders and set up seperate repositories for each section, as this approach (seems) to be more in line with the submission format indicated in the Big Project description.
- 25/11/2024 - Made some readbility edits to the juniper notebooks and ReadMe and started on part 2 of assignment 5.
- 14/12/2024 - Edited repository name in line with assigment 1 requirments.
